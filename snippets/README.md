# Snippets

This directory contains snippets of code and design decisions that I've found useful.
Each snippet is a self-contained file, with a description, justification, and references.

Hopefully, this will be useful to stop me from searching for that one StackOverflow answer I found 3 years ago, and to
help me remember why I made certain decisions.
