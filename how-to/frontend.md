# Frontend References

Javascript, Typescript, React, Next.JS references. For now, catch-all while I give myself a frontend
crash course..

## Envrionment Setup

Environment setup for frontend dev.

### node.js and npm

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a node version manager, to install node.

Installs via [script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)

Verify with `command -v nvm`, which should output `nvm`. See [usage](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage)

To install latest node: `nvm install node` or specific version: `nvm install 14.7.0`.

Switch between versions with `nvm use node`, to override the default in each new shell.
